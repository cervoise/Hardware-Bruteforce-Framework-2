#Firt

Be sure that you do not have any alternative, for example, on a Windows Tablet, the availability to add an Ethernet port over USB and to run a wordlist attack over RDP (hydra does that).

#Prepare the attack

First you need to try a few passwords manually. Plug a keyboard on your target and analyze what is needed in order to do a password try (and failed) and to come back to the initial state.

For example, on Dell Latitude UEFI, you need to :
- enter the password, 
- then carriage return,
- wait a little,
- a message box with a bad password message appears, another carriage return for closing it,
- you're back to the initial state.

You have to transcribe that in a specific langage. The keywords are:
- delay XXXX: wait XXXX ms
- login: type the login
- password: the framework types the password
- enter/backspace/escape/tabulation: type the special key
- screenshot: do a screenshot using a webcam

#Prepare the attack when the target is locking every n tries

#Prepare the attack (only if you're doing screenshots)

If you plan to take screenshot to each try, put your target in a dark place, where the luminosity will not change. For example in a box.

Then you need to take picture of failed tries. You may have several pictures, for example on Android, you have different screen if you just failed, or if this is the fifth fail in a row.

#Run the attack

#Run the analysis

You can run the analysis after the attack on the Pi with ... This can took a lot of time (....). So you may want to run the analysis on another laptop.

Export the screenshot files, and run ...

An option with a web server and a live analysis is under dev.
